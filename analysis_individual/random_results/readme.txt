This folder contains the statistical results of shared syllable, transition, position and sequunce within/between populations.
Assuming the total number of sequences from one population is N and the total number of bats is n.
Half or 3/4 sequences of each population were randomly selected for analysis separately (N/2 or 3N/4). Then half/3quarters of bats numbers were randomly selected (n/2 or 3n/4). So, the number of sequences of each bat would be (N/2)/(n/2) or (3N/4)/(3n/4). For specific quantities, please see constant.py.
